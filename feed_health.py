"""Feed diagnosis core for the US100Cash M15 stack (`/opt/nasdaq`).

One place that answers the only question that matters when a `STALE_FEED`
journal row appears: **why** is there no usable closed M15 bar?

The engine (`engine.py`) and the triage CLI (`tools/feed_doctor.py`) both import
this module, so the alert text in `journal.csv` and the doctor's verdict can
never drift apart.

Three artefacts are diagnosed:

  `mt5_last_candle.json`   published by `tools/mt5_feed.py` - the closed M15 bar
  `mt5_feed_health.json`   published by `tools/mt5_feed.py` - sidecar heartbeat
  `journal.csv`            engine alerts - used to spot counter resets

Key design rule: **"sidecar unit is active" is not "feed is healthy", and
"engine has not processed a bar recently" is not "the feed is 20 minutes old".**
A missing/unreadable/foreign feed file used to be reported as
"no new closed M15 candles for 20 min", where 20 min was really just *engine
process uptime* - the number reset to zero on every restart. This module always
reports a `reason`, the true freeze instant, and the file's own age.

Importable without MetaTrader5, Flask, or any third-party package.
